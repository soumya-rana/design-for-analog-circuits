# design-for-analog-circuits
collection of my simulation work done in the "design for analog circuits" course at IISc Bangalore.

1. Simple amplifier circuits - BJT CE amplifier, OP-AMP based noninverting amplifier, OP-AMP based buffer
2. BJT differential amplifiers - Fully differential amplifier with emitter degeneration and tail resistor.
3. Instrumentation amplifier and negative impedance converter.
4. OP-AMP feedback topologies - series-series, series-shunt, shunt-series, shunt-shunt
5. Rectifiers - Classical full bridge rectifier and precision rectifier.
6. Linear regulators.
7. First order active filters - low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-reject.
8. Second order active filters - KRC low-pass, KRC high-pass, Twin-T notch and Multiple feedback band-pass filters.
9. Oscillators - Op amp based relaxation oscillator, RC phase shift oscillator, three phase oscillator and wein bridge oscillator.
10. Low frequency sensor amplifiers and phase tripler.
11. Photoresistor optocoupler based voltage divider, voltage controlled oscillators and active gain compensated amplifier.
12. Gyrator based circuits.
