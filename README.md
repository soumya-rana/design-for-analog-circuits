# design-for-analog-circuits
collection of my simulation work done in the "design for analog circuits" course at IISc Bangalore.

1. Simple amplifier circuits - BJT CE amplifier, OP-AMP based noninverting amplifier, OP-AMP based buffer
2. BJT differential amplifiers - Fully differential amplifier with emitter degeneration and tail resistor.
